# Hazard Reading and Fitting

A tool incorporated within IPBSD to perform second-order hazard fitting if necessary.

The tool works with pickle files to generate outputs in pickle format for the later stages of the framework.

Required python libraries: matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scipy

### Future updates

* [ ] Output files as .csv
